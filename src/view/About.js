            Throughout our time as Computer Science students at the College of
            Staten Island, the only opportunity we had for showcasing our skills
            in a hackathon environment is once a year during the CUNY Hackathon.
            Not to mention, many CSI computer science students do not get the
            recognition they deserve, which is where the CSI Hackathon comes in.
            The CSI Hackathon would be open and welcoming to all CSI students!
